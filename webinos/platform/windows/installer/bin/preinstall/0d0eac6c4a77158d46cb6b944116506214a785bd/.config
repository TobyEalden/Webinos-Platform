widget.description.unicode: OpenCityGuide is a cross-platform mobile application built on top of the open data platforms of different cities. The application accesses the touristic data from different OD platforms and aggregates them with user generated data such as ratings, comments, checkins, etc. and 3rd party content such as photos from Flickr and linked data from DPPedia in one single application. After starting the App, the user can select a city from the list or allow the application to detect the city automatically by accessing the GPS module. After a city is determined, the application shows all touristic attractions for the selected city either on a map or as a list. If the user selects a point of interest, the application shows more details such as description, opening hours, entry fees, etc. for the selected place. Furthermore, the user is able in this view to do the following actions: 1) add new comment or show comments from other users related to the selected place, 2) set rating or show the average rating of the selected place, 3) checkin in the selected place. New features such as offline capability, social media integration and personalized recommendation will be available in future releases.
